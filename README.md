# sh-it

Want to just get in a container and hack something `shit` real quick?

Well `shit`, so do I.

Although every time I want to do it I have to look up the `shit` Docker arguments.

Then I came up with `shit`.

## Prerequisites

* Docker

## Install

Add [shit.sh](shit.sh) as an alias.

## Try it!

* `shit python`
* `shit alpine`
* `shit node`
